          <h2>Self-Confidence</h2> 

          <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h5>  
          <p>
            Mindfulness and self-awareness are similar. Mindfulness is paying attention to the moment without judgement. Self-awareness is also paying attention but goes further than one's moment to moment emotional experience to "knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions."

          <h5>Journaling</h5>
          <p>
            This week I tried journaling. I liked how it can be described as a 'brain-dump'. It was surprisingly easy to write heaps within the 3-minute set time. Both the process of just writing down what initially came to mind and then re-reading it brought a small sense of clarity to my thoughts and was somewhat helpful in organising my thinking.

          <h5>My Emotions Are Not Me</h5>
          <p>
            I found the following quote insightful...
            "Thoughts and emotions are like clouds - some beautiful, some dark - while our core being is the sky. CLouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go. Similarly, thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in mind and body that come and go."

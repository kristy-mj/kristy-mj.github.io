          <h2>Leadership</h2> 
          <p><em>Being effective and loved at the same time</em></p>

          <h5>Compassionate Leadership</h5>  
          <p>
            In Chapter 8 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> compassion is said to create highly effective leaders. Compassion is described as having three components:
            <li>A cognitive component - 'I understand you'</li>
            <li>An affective component - 'I feel for you'</li>
            <li>A motivational component - 'I want to help you'</li>
            In great leadership the shift from self to others - going from 'I' to 'We' -is key. This is something I have experienced in past employment. When my employers have taken the time to listen, understand and help me, I have found myself enjoying work more and wanting to do my best at the job.
          </p>

          <h5>Meditation</h5>
          <p>
            To train compassion I tried the multiplying goodness meditation and the Tonglen meditation.
            I found these meditations helped me think about others and appreciate them more. The concept of breathing in goodness and mutliplying it to breathe out is new to me but it was surprisingly easy to visualise. The Tonglen mediation of breathing in suffering to transform and then exhale love, kindness and compassion wasn't so easy to focus on but would be interesting to continue exploring.
          </p>

          <h5>SCARF Model</h5>
          <p>
            SCARF is a model which breaks down social experiences by looking at 5 elements that drive social behaviour. These are:
            <li>S - Status: one's relative importance</li>
            <li>C - Certainty: and that uncertainty takes away valuable brain resources</li>
            <li>A - Autonomy: the perception of exerting control over one's environment</li>
            <li>R - Relatedness: the perception of whether another person is a 'friend' or 'foe'</li>
            <li>F - Fairness</li>
            Looking back at my Phase-0 experience, different aspects of the SCARF model are apparent. Having certainty about what I needed to achieve each week helped give me control over how I planned out my week and worked out how to best use my time. I was also encouraged in interactions with my cohort and finding myself able to relate to them.
            Moving into Bootcamp this model applies in how I will interact with others. By taking the time to get to know others, better communication and understanding will be formed creating a positive 'relatedness' even when things are difficult. I also hope tp apply fairness in all situations and acknowledge good ideas from others.
          </p>

          <h5>Diffcult Conversations</h5>
          <p>
            When thinking about having a difficult conversation I found it really helpful to think about the different elements of a conversation.
            <li>Content - what happened?</li>
            <li>Feelings - what emotions are involved?</li>
            <li>Identify - what does this say about me? Particularly, am I a competent? or a good person? or worthy of love?</li>
            Having this awareness of how the other person may feel and react was really helpful to be able to empathize with which led to a better understanding for both of us.

          <h5>My Goals For The Week</h5>
  
          <p>
            My goals for the weeks were:
            <li>Complete Eloquent JavaScript exercises.</li>
            <li>Timebox 4 hours of JavaScript FreeCodeCamp challenges.</li>
            <li>Create website for hat project with pages for home, about, hat builder, and contact.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            I completed the Eloquent JavaScript exercises and created a basic website for my hat project. There are elements of the site that I would like to develop further including incorporating a hamburger menu for smaller screens and fixing a couple of layout issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did not complete my second goal - setting aside time to work on JavaScript challenges in FreeCodeCamp. Instead, I decided to focus on learning elements of JavaScript that would be more relevant to my personal project of trying to create an app where the user can design their own hat. I spent time learning about canvas and how to create brush and colour fill elements using JavaScript. This is something I really enjoyed and I hope to continue to spend more time on over the coming week.
          </p>

          <h5>Stretch Goal</h5>
          <p>
            My stretch goal was to plan how I would build the 'design your own hat' feature. While I donâ€™t have a pseudocoded plan all ready to implement, I did research and have some ideas about how this could be achieved using canvas. This has given me a clear starting point to develop on from over the next couple of weeks.
          </p>

          <h5>Technical Knowledge</h5>
          <p>
            This week I learned about canvas and how to create a drawing app using html and JavaScript. I found lots of online resources that were really helpful in introducing canvas and how it can be used. I am still finding JavaScript confusing and rely heavily on notes and online info so am super happy when sometimes things work.
          </p>
          <p>
            This week I enjoyed creating a drawing app using canvas. Although it is fairly basic and I very closely followed a video tutorial, I am pretty excited about the possibilities and am hoping that as I explore this further I'll be able to develop my understanding of JavaScript too.

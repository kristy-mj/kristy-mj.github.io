          <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2> 

          <p>
            The 'mindfulness conversation' was an interesting exercise - the converstaion did feel rather artificial at times however it did make each of us pay attention to the other person and get a good understanding of what they were communicating. I don't think this is how I would want to communicate with others all the time but the exercise did get me to really consider how I listen to and talk with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            More mindfulness in the conversations I have by giving others my full attention is something I would like to develop. 
          </p>
          <p>
            'Mindfulness in activity' had some interesting points too about bringing full attention to the task at hand in every day activities. For example, really focusing on every movement and sensation in the body when walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found the suggestion of making meditation a realistic practice builds on the idea of small steps can help build habits. Even just focusing on one breath a day as an initial practice seems like a do-able goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            And lastly,  particularly in relation to this weeks habit to persevere, I found encouragement in "...when change does come, it will come suddenly, and every moment of effort brings you a little closer to that point". Here's hoping this is true in both meditation and learning to code.

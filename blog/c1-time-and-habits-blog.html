      <h3>Time And Habit Techniques</h3>
      <h5>March 18, 2016</h5>
      
      <p>Managing time well is definitely a challenge, particularly with the remote learning phase. So far I have been trying to use my time productively however this has sometimes been difficult. Surprisingly the Toggl app has been quite helpful in keeping track of my time and making me more aware of areas I may be spending too much time on. Using my time efficently is something I am keen to continue to improve on. Limiting time to work on challenges and setting deadlines is something I will continue to implement. As a last minute procrastinator, I might explore giving myself even less time to really push my productivity.</p>

      <p>Another idea I found interesting in some of the course material is the emphasis of focusing on small tasks. Instead of attempting to make big changes, start by thinking really, really small. Small wins achieved over time can lead to confidence and a growth mindset. Through making the objective precise, tasks will be easier to accomplish and success is more likely.</p>

      <p>Hopefully over the next few weeks my time management and learning habits will develop and improve as I discover what works best for me.</p>

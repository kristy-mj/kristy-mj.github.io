      <h3>Grids, Responsive Webpages and Semantics</h3>
      <h5>March 23, 2016</h5>
        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
          <p>Almost every website follows some sort of grid structure to lay out the different elements that make up the page. Grid based design enables the developer to use CSS to control how wide these elements are and how they're arranged.

        <h3>What is all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
          <p> There are many different ways people browse the web - some use computers or laptops, others use tablets or their phones. As a result the screen size and orientation that webpages are looked at varies widely. Responsive webpages are webpages that can change to fit the screen they are being viewed on. This is awesome news for user friendliness and can make for a happy website experience.

        <h3>Semantic Structure</h3>
          <p> 'Semantic' is relating to meaning in language or logic. In web development, when building a website, a semantic structure can be created by using html tags. The tags used to structure the content are used in relation to the meaning of the content. For example the 'p' tag in html is used to show that the enclosed content is a paragragh. Another example is the 'nav' tag which is used to for navigation elements such as global links.

          <h2>Motivation</h2> 

          <h5>Pleasure, Passion, Purpose</h5>  
          <p>
            Chapter 6 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> describes three types of happiness in relation to being motivated in the workplace:
          </p>
          <p>  
            <strong>Pleasure</strong> - chasing the pleasure of the moment - being motivated for the next high.<br>
            <strong>Passion</strong> - when peak performance meets peak engagement often achieving a state of flow. When the task is challenging but the level of difficulty is just right so one's skills can be used to the utmost.<br>
            <strong>Purpose</strong> - being a part of something bigger then yourself that has meaning to you.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            These have varying levels of sustainability - happiness gained from pleasure is the least sustainable, happiness from flow is much more sustainable and having a higher purpose is highly sustainable. This suggests that to be happy and motivated at work is to find our own higher purpose - knowing what we value the most and what is the most meaningful to us.

          <h5>My Core Values and What I Stand For</h5>
          <p>
            Some values that are important to me include:
          </p>
          <p>  
            <strong>Integrity</strong> - doing what I say and being what I am<br>
            <strong>Authenticity</strong> - being open, real and honest with myself and others<br>
            <strong>Persistence</strong> - committing to things and sticking at them<br>
            <strong>Relationships</strong> - building and growing connections with others
          </p>
          <h5>Resilience</h5>
          <p>
            I found the ideas about resilience really encouraging and easy to relate to - not just in web development but also general everyday life. The following quote sums it up nicely...
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"If your idea of exploration is to always know where you are and to be inside your zone of competence, you won't do wild new shit. You have to be confused, upset, think you're stupid. If you're not willing to do that, you can't go outside the box."</em><br>
            -Nathan Myhrvold.

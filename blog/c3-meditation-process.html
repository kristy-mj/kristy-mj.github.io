          <h2>Meditation & Process</h2> 
          <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
          <p>
            The 'process over product' concept helped me to think about what the most important elements of the site were that I wanted to include. Rather than being distracted and spending too much time on visual aspects of the site I tried to keep the site design simple yet incorporate key elements. By focusing more on the process I have been able to better learn how to use frameworks to develop a site.
          </p>
          <h5>Meditation</h5>
          <p>
            I generally associated meditation with buddhist monks and yogis and considered it some mystical thing people did as a spiritual practice. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            However, after reading chapter two of 'Search Inside Yourself' I discovered that there have been studies done on business people in the corporate world who practice meditation. It was surprising to see the different scientific research that has been done about meditation and I found it interesting to read of the positive effects meditation can have on different issues including anxiety, brain function and attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also found the explanantion of different ways someone can meditate helpful such as having eyes open/closed and having an alert but relaxed posture. I liked the idea of sitting like a mountain - majestic, dignified and awe-inspiring.

          <h2>Problem Solving</h2> 

          <h5>Getting Blocked</h5>  
          <p>
            This week once I had begun the JavaScript Racer assignment I got blocked pretty quickly. It was tricky trying to figure out where even to start. I wasn't sure which things we had learned so far would be the best to apply to this assignment. And it was pretty depressing being confused even at the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get over this initial challenge of even just starting I found pseudocoding really helpful. Once I had a basic idea of what functions I needed to make I found it easier to look through my notes and Google for help. I learned that even just speaking out what you are trying to acheive can help.
          </p>

          <h5>Solving Problems</h5>
          <p>
            In this weeks JavaScript Racer assignment I found it difficult getting my head around how to move the active class along the table. I managed to solve this by finding different examples of how others had acheived similar effects and inspecting the code. This helped me to work backwards and figure out how it could work in my own code. This process was frustrating at times but also rewarding when it worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find trying things out and Googling if I get stuck an effective way of problem solving. Reading error messages, especially looking up what they may mean is also helpful.
          </p>

          <h5>JavaScript Array Methods</h5>
          <p>
            These array methods are handy for writing succinct code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Map: the map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filter: the filter() method creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the function e.g. finding all the items in the array that have the name 'pink'.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reduce: the reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) has to reduce it to a single value.
          </p>
          <p>

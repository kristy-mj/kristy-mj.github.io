          <h2>Design To Web</h2> 
          <h5>What is a responsive site? Why is responsiveness important?</h5>
          <p>
            A responsive site is a website that works well on every screen no matter the screen size. Responsive sites are flexible and adjust depending on the browser screen size.
            Responsiveness is important so that the site visitor can have a good website experience no matter what device they are using - from mobiles and tablets through to laptops and desktop computers.
          </p>
          <h5>What is mobile first design? Why is it important?</h5>
          <p>
            Mobile first design is when you design a website for the small screen of a mobile before developing it for bigger screens such as desktop computers.
          </p>
          <p> 
            This approach keeps the focus on the key content of the site as what can fit on a small mobile screen is limited. Mobile first design also helps prevent small devices from having to parse heaps of unused CSS that is only relevent to the bigger screens.
          </p>
          <h5>What are frameworks? What are the pros & cons?</h5>
          <p>
            In web design a framework can be used to support the development of websites. It comes as a package made up of files and folders of code such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. Instead of developers having to always build websites from scratch, developers can use the code provided in a selected framework as a base to start building a site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a framework can help speed up the process by eliminating a lot of work and providing tidy code. It can also be helpful in collaborative work as well as in the understanding of good practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as frameworks are pre-made code there can be a lot of unused code leftover that isn't relevant to the site. Also, content and presentation can become mixed. Another downside is that the developer doesnt't learn how to do it themselves.
          </p>
          <h5>What is a wireframe? Why do we use it?</h5>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a sketch of a website that shows how all the visual elements will be laid out. It helps establish the key content and how it will be viewed on the page. Because it is a simple sketch and doesn't include details such as colours and fonts, it helps keep communication with the client focused on just where elements are located and how prominent they are on the page. A wireframe can also be used as an underlay in the design of the sites styles.
          </p>

            <div class="four columns">

          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="eight columns">
              <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Wireframes" style="width:100%; height:100%;">
            </div>
            <div class="four columns">
              <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Wireframes" style="width:100%; height:100%;">
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            I tried to keep my wireframes simple however there were a couple of things I found difficult to implement.
          </p>
          <p>
            I initially wanted a hamburger menu for the mobile size screen however it seems I'd have to use JavaScript. I also found it hard creating a footer that would stay fixed at the bottom of the screen.
          </p>

      <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>

      <h3>Search Inside Yourself - Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <p>
        Chapter 1 of 'Search Inside Yourself' introduced some interesting ideas about emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to monitor one's own and others feelings and emotions to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions. Knowing oneself lies at the heart of emotional intelligence. In the tech world, conceptual thinking and analytical ability are important however emotional intelligence is also of great value. This includes; strong achievement drive and high achievement standards, ability to influence, initiative in taking on challenges and self confidence.

        Emotional competencies can be gained with practice. Self awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills are all qualities that have potential to be developed. Building on these qualities can help you function at a higher level than what you are already capable of - enabling you to become the best you you can be. To begin; the foundation of emotional intelligence can be formed through training a strong and perceptive attention which enables calmness and clarity. This can be practiced through mindfulness - paying attention to the moment and just being.

    <h3>My Two Minutes of Mindfulness</h3>
    <p>
      The practice of mindfulness is new to me however it was pretty easy to just focus on my breathing and 'just be'. To start with, two minutes doing nothing seemed rather unproductive and my thoughts were all over the show however by the end I was starting to appreciate just taking the time to do nothing and simply pay attention to the moment.

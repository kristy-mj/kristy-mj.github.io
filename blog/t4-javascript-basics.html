          <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2> 
          <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
          <p>
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS are used in the building of websites however each has a different job. 
            HTML is used for structuring the content of a site. CSS is used for applying all visual styles.
            JavaScript is used to make HTML pages dynamic and is usually used for interactive functionality. It tells the browser how to change the webpage in response to something that happens e.g. something is clicked on or the input value in a form is changed. JavaScript enables webpages to have more meaningful, real-time engagement with the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although HTML, CSS and JavaScript all work alongside each other, they should always be referenced in seperate files - this makes for files that are more logical and simpler to handle, easier management and easier re-purposing (i.e. if the site needs to be re-designed or needs to work differently on different screens and browsers).
          </p>

          <h5>Control Flow and Loops</h5>
          <p> 
            Control flow decides what part of the code will be executed. e.g. if this is true (do this…) or else if this is true (do this…) or else (do this…). Loops let you run a block of code a certain number of times e.g. do (this…) while (this happens…). 
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if I was going for a run the control flow would assess the weather and determine whether I wear a t-shirt, jersey or jacket. Then I will run. The placing of one foot in front of another is a repeated action so the loop will handle this by repeating this process while I am out running and then it will stop when I arrive home.
          </p>

          <h5>Accessing data from arrays vs. object literals</h5>
          <p>
            Arrays store lists of data in numerical order and the data can be accessed using the numerical index. Object literals are collections of property-value pairs and the data can be accessed using the property name as the index. Put simply, arrays have order, objects don’t.
          </p>

          <h5>Functions. And why they are useful</h5>
          <p>
            A function takes inputs, does something with them, and then produces an output.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are pretty handy because the function repeats the same instructions each time but different inputs can be given to achieve different outputs. It is a good idea to use a function instead of typing the same thing over and over again if only a small part needs modifying each time.

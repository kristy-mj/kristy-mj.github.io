    <h3>What is HTML, CSS and DOM?</h3>
    <p> 
      HTML is the structure of the website and CSS is the styling of the site. How the browser interprets the HTML turns it into the DOM. The DOM defines the logical structure of the site and through the DOM site elements can be accessed and manipulated.</p>
    <p>
      This could be very loosely compared to an IKEA table. The form and structure of the table are like the HTML. The table colour and style is similar to CSS. But when the buyer looks at that flat pack table and puts it together this could be compared to the DOM. Usually it'll be like what they ordered but they may need to go to the garage to find another screw.

    <h3>What is it meant by boxifying design?</h3>
    <p> 
      Every HTML element on a webpage is actually a box. To manage the page layout, all the different elements of the webpage are broken down into indiviual boxes within the page.</p>
        
    <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
    <p>
      The box model is used for the styling of the page with CSS. Every HTML element is surrounded by a box. The box has 4 layers. The inner box contains the content. This is surrounded by the padding box, which is surrounded by the border box. The margin box then surrounds the whole lot.

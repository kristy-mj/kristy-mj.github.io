          <h5>Growing Trust and Sincerity</h5>  
          <p>
            Chapter 7 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> introduces ideas for developing empathy through understanding and connecting with others. Some of the insight and techniques mentioned for growing trust and sincerity include assuming the other person is "just like me" and simply relating to the other person even as a fellow human being. When I try to see the perspective of others I find I am able to understand and relate to them better.
          </p>
          <h5>Empathic Listening</h5>
          <p>
            Trying empathic listening made me pay more attention to what the other person was saying but also helped bring awareness to how they were being personally affected by their situation. A curiousity for what they were feeling helped me understand and relate more to where they were coming from.
          </p>
          <h5>Loving Kindness</h5>
          <p>
            I liked the ideas in the loving kindness meditation of recognizing and acknowledging similarities between oneself and the other person. Hoping for others and thinking of their happiness also made me somewhat happier. So much happiness. Happy.

            And the political awareness exercise has made me more appreciative of both sides of the story...<br> 
            Perspective One: I'm telling you how and where to drive because I know the way and have some tips I have found useful in the past vs. Perspective 2: Someone telling you how to drive when you are a competent driver with eyes that can see and you know a shortcut.

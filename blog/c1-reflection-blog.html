    <h3>Week One</h3>
    <h5>March 17, 2016</h5>
    
    <p>Coming into EDA I don't know much about web development and have minimal experience writing code. I come from a background in textile design and my experience with computers has predominantely been using design software in the creation of visual elements. I am aware of my inexperience and can easily say I don't know what I am doing. This unknowing about what I am getting into is a bit scary. </p>

    <p>Working through the first week at EDA this concern has lessened and developed more into an excitement at the prospect of learning much more. Initially I was worried I wouldn't know enough to keep up however as I have worked through the weeks tasks, both struggling with and solving issues, I have found it is at a level I am able to understand and I'm beginning to really enjoy the challenges.</p>

    <p>Even though everything has just been online so far, I have found the culture EDA aims to cultivate within each cohort really supportive and it looks like this could be invaluable to the course.</p>

    <p>At the moment, this is all still feeling fairly new however so far this sense of unknowing sits ok with me and I am really looking forward to the next few months.</p>
